      <p>I am an Analyst for almost 5 years and I am looking for a job closely
        related to Python. If possible, as <b>Junior Python Developer</b>.
        I would like to work in an environment where I can be taught by people more
        advanced than me and receive regular feedback. I am a fast learner with
        high eager and motivation to learn. However, skills which are not used
        can be simply forgotten and I would like to avoid that.
        I spend a lot of free time expanding my knowledge and I would never
        be able to learn that much on myself as I could do at the regular job.
        Not only because of less time spend on advanced tasks, but also
        because nobody could give me a significant opinion.
        Nevertheless, I think I am quite good at demanding assignments,
        even if I do not have a sufficient background. I am always trying to
        find solution and in most cases I do. Not only using Stack Overflow
        and similar pages, but also by reading documentation and analyzing what
        can be done and how. I rather ask questions "How to do ..." instead of
        "Is it possible to do...". I am mostly a self learner, hence I know
        I lack of professional experience and this is what I am looking for.

            I studied on the University of Science and Technology. I became a
            transport student after many years of humanistic education. I was
            part of theater group, writing for school paper and all of the way
            expanding myself in the area totally opposite to science. I wanted
            to be a journalist, maybe psychologist definitely not Data Analyst
            not even a programmer. That time I didn't even know that something
            like Python exists. Unfortunately, but maybe luckily it was not easy
            to get accepted for fields I saw my future that time. So at the last
            year of my High School Education I started thinking about other
            directions and I reevaluated my needs. I noticed maths isn't so
            hard after all and it could be good to become an engineer maybe.
            I wrote my thesis about possibility of obtaining fuel from waste
            plastics and I became excited to create machine for this purpose,
            hence I changed direction into Mechanics and Machine Building
            (there was also no continuation for my engineer field that time).
            While studying I became more interested in exploitation and risks,
            so I changed my path again and chose master thesis related to that
            topic.

            During my University education I was also working at different places,
            such as grocery shop, department store with kitchen appliances and
            as a coffee machine seller. Once I started to have less classes
            during day time (I was on full time studies) I started thinking
            about some serious job for the first time. I didn't know what I
            would like to do that time. After a few years of studies I knew that
            what I liked the most was data management, preparing reports and doing
            some projects. I sent my resume to 2 or 3 places and that is how my
            professional journey has started.

            Once I started my first serious job I understood processes really
            quickly. After a few months I already took part in first automation
            related to RPA. I was testing the solution, creating some SOP and
            presentations. It was something that got me really interested.
            So I didn't stop there. Along with my colleagues created a new
            solution to our process. It took one year to succeed and it was
            worth it. I learned a lot, but still I wasn't doing anything on
            my own. It was VBA related solution, so I started digging, took
            some Udemy classes to learn VBA, but it was not enough for me. 
            I wanted to do more. More advanced, more challenging. I did some
            research about programming languages and my choice came to Python.
            First, I tried to learn on my own. But I started thinking, what if
            I will learn bad practices? I read some articles about clean code,
            PEP 8 and stuff like that and I knew I wanted to do it well. It was
            my first programming language after all, so I started
            Data Science Bootcamp.
